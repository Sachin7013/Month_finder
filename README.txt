Description:
This is a simple C program that takes a number (between 1 and 12) as input and prints the corresponding month of the year. The user is prompted to input a number between 1 and 12, and the program uses a switch statement to output the corresponding month's name (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.). If the user enters an invalid number (less than 1 or greater than 12), the program will print "invalid input".

Features:
Input: The user provides an integer value (1 to 12).
Output: The program outputs the name of the month corresponding to the input.
Error Handling: If the input is outside the valid range (1 to 12), the program will display "invalid input".

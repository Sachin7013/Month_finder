Overview
This C program takes an integer input representing the number of a month (1 to 12) and outputs the corresponding abbreviated month name. The program uses a switch statement to map the input number to the correct month.

Functionality
The program prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 12.
It then uses a switch statement to check the number and print the corresponding month abbreviation (e.g., 1 -> "jan", 2 -> "feb", etc.).
If the input number is outside the valid range (1 to 12), it outputs "invalid input".
Example
Input: 5
Output: may
Code Walkthrough
The program starts by declaring an integer variable n.
The user is prompted to enter a number (1 to 12).
The switch statement checks the value of n:
For each valid month number (1 to 12), it prints the corresponding month abbreviation.
If the value of n is outside this range, the program prints "invalid input".
The program ends with a return 0.
